The requirements for the proposed dashboard are:
1. A single-screen presentation of at least 10 countries’ economic health and the profile of
their economic activity profile.
2. Clear, effective representational presentation of all factors in a coherent, intuitively
comprehensive form.
3. A schema applicable to the full range of countries presented in the dataset without
modification to the dashboard form or structure. (i.e., the dashboard should support a sideby-side comparison of multiple countries and/or financial years).
4. Presentation of future prediction/trend for economic profile based on historical data.
5. Relational modelling showing relative performance against stochastically defined groups of
countries within the data set.


The requirements for the proposed statistical analysis are:
1. Define a research objective based on the dataset. For instance, to compare the trade situation of
the least developed countries with developed countries.
2. Based on the objective, select at least 10 suitable countries of your choice.
3. Choose a set of indicators according to the objective with at least 10 years of data.
4. Start to complete the following tasks. Also, present and interpret your findings and results in the
report as much as you can and show the thorough SAS analytics steps.
4.1. Do a comprehensive descriptive statistical analysis (e.g., Mean, Median, Mode, Standard
deviation, Skewness and Kurtosis) on the data.

4.2. Do a correlation analysis for the indicators as much as you think is enough for the defined
objective.
4.3. Do a regression analysis. Explain why the selected regression technique is better for the
defined objective and show if you’ve found any similar research in the literature.
4.4. As a researcher, do a comparative analysis of the hypothesis testing approaches and explain
when and why you use them? Then define two hypotheses related to the objective and test
them
